# Temperature-Prediction
## Project Description
A simple temperature prediction using machine learning. In this project, I'm using several regression model. The best result is LightGBM but when I try to run it locally using streamlit it seems can't be installed. Hence the model saved is Random Forest Regressor. This project also includes Streamlit app where if you have the dataset with the same format you can simply just click predict after loading the dataset. Also in streamlit there's a folium map and displaying the temperature using heatmap to show if certain area is cooler or hotter than its surrounding places
